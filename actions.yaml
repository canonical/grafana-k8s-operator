get-admin-password:
  description: |
    Get the initial admin password for the Grafana web interface. This is generated at charm
    deployment time. If the password has been changed, a notice of that fact will be returned by
    this action instead.

    The admin password can be manually set with:
    `microk8s.kubectl exec -n MODEL_NAME grafana-0 -c grafana -- grafana-cli admin reset-admin-password new_password`
