"""grafana_metadata.

This library implements endpoint wrappers for the grafana-metadata interface.  The grafana-metadata interface is used to
transfer information about an instance of Grafana, such as how to access and uniquely identify it.  Typically, this is
useful for charms that operate a Grafana instance to give other applications access to its API.

## Usage

### Requirer

GrafanaMetadataRequirer is a wrapper for pulling data from the grafana-metadata interface.  To use it in your charm:

* observe the relation-changed event for this relation wherever your charm needs to use this data (this endpoint wrapper
  DOES NOT automatically observe any events)
* wherever you need access to the data, call `GrafanaMetadataRequirer(...).get_data()`

An example implementation is:

```python
class FooCharm(CharmBase):
    def __init__(self, framework):
        super().__init__(framework)

        grafana_mnetadata = GrafanaMetadataRequirer(self.model.relations, "grafana-metadata")

        self.framework.observe(self.on["grafana-metadata"].relation_changed, self._on_grafana_metadata_changed)

    def _on_grafana_metadata_changed(self):
        data = grafana_mnetadata.get_data()
        ...
```

Where you also add relation to your `charmcraft.yaml` or `metadata.yaml` (note that GrafanaMetadataRequirer is designed
for relating to a single application and must be used with limit=1 as shown below):

```yaml
requires:
  grafana-metadata:
    limit: 1
    interface: grafana_metadata
```

### Provider

GrafanaMetadataProvider is a wrapper for publishing data to charms related using the grafana-metadata interface.  Note
that `GrafanaMetadataProvider` *does not* manage any events, but instead provides a `publish` method for sending data to
all related applications.  Triggering `publish` appropriately is left to the charm author, although generally you want
to do this at least during the `relation_joined` and `leader_elected` events.  An example implementation is:

```python
class FooCharm(CharmBase):
    def __init__(self, framework):
        super().__init__(framework)
        self.grafana_metadata = GrafanaMetadataProvider(
            relations=self.model.relations,
            relation_name="grafana-metadata",
            app=self.app,
        )

        self.framework.observe(self.on.leader_elected, self.do_something_to_publish)
        self.framework.observe(self._charm.on["grafana-metadata"].relation_joined, self.do_something_to_publish)
        self.framework.observe(self.on.some_event_that_changes_grafana_metadata, self.do_something_to_publish)

    def do_something_to_publish(self, e):
        self.grafana_metadata.publish(...)
```

Where you also add the following to your `charmcraft.yaml` or `metadata.yaml`:

```yaml
provides:
  grafana-metadata:
    interface: grafana_metadata
```
