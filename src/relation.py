class ProviderBase(Object):
    """Manages relations of service providers.

    A :class:`ProviderBase` object manages relations of a service provider
    charms, with charms that consume those services. When a consumer
    charm joins the relation a provider object informs it of the type
    and version of the service provided. Providers may also be
    instrumented to inform consumer charms of any relevant
    information, for example configuration settings. This is done
    using the `service` and `version` argument of the
    :class:`ProviderBase` constructor.

    Any charm that provides a service may choose to do so through the
    :class:`ProviderBase` object simply by instantiating it in the charm's
    `__init__` method, as follows

    Example::

        self.provider = Provider(self, relation_name, service, version)
        ...
        self.provider.ready()

    It is important to invoke `ready()` on the :class:`ProviderBase`
    object, in order to let the consumer charm know that the provider
    is serving requests. This is done by setting a Boolean flag
    `ready` in the data forwarded to the consumer charm. A provider
    charm may toggle this flag by invoking `unready()` when it
    is unable to service any requests for example prior to a series
    upgrade. After an upgrade the :class:`ProviderBase` object notifies
    consumer charms by re-sending type, version and any other data to
    the consumer. Even though :class:`ProviderBase` objects only handle
    relation joined and provider upgrade events, they may be
    sub-classed to extend their functionality in any way desired.

    Args:
        charm: :class:`ops.charm.CharmBase` derived object that is
            instantiating :class:`ProviderBase`. This is almost always
            `self`.
        name: string name of relation (as defined in `metadata.yaml`) that
            consumer charms will use to interact with provider charms.
        service: a string naming service being provided by this charm.
            For example for a MySQL charm service could be "mysql".
            This name must be consistent between :class:`ProviderBase`
            and :class:`ConsumerBase`
        version: a string providing version of service provided by the
            charm. This version string can be in any form that is
            compatible with the
            `semver <https://pypi.org/project/semver/>`_ Python package.
            It is important that the version is obtained by actually
            querrying the deployed application rather than being written
            into the code. This is because the same charm may be used
            to deploy different versions of a service (application).
