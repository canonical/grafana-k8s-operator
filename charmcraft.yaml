  Grafana provides dashboards for monitoring data and this
  charm is written to allow for HA on Kubernetes and can take
  multiple data sources (for example, Prometheus).

actions:
  get-admin-password:
    description: |
      Get the dashboard url and initial admin password for the Grafana web interface. Initial
      admin password is generated at charm deployment time. If the password has been changed,
      a notice of that fact will be returned by this action instead.

config:
  options:
    allow_anonymous_access:
      type: boolean
      default: false
      description: |
        Whether Grafana should allow anonymous access to dashboards. Unless
        you have some other authentication mechanism in front of your deployment,
        you likely do not want to enable this.
    allow_embedding:
      type: boolean
      default: false
      description: |
        Whether Grafana should allow embedding dashboards using iframes. Unless
        you have a clear reason for doing so, you likely do not want to enable this.
    log_level:
      type: string
      description: |
        Logging level for Grafana. Options are “debug”, “info”,
        “warn”, “error”, and “critical”.
      default: info
    admin_user:
      description: The Grafana administrative user
      type: string
      default: admin
    web_external_url:
      description: |
        DEPRECATED. This config option is no longer used, in favor of "skipPrefix".

        The URL under which Grafana is externally reachable (for example,
        if Grafana is served via a reverse proxy).

        Used for generating relative and absolute links back to
        Grafana itself. If the URL has a path portion, it will be used to
        prefix all HTTP endpoints served by Grafana.

        If omitted, relevant URL components will be derived automatically.

        If provided, this should be a complete URI, including scheme, or a
        fully qualified subpath starting with `/`.

        If Grafana is being served directly from the root of a fully-qualified
        host or a bare A record, this may be omitted.
      type: string
      default: ""
    enable_auto_assign_org:
      description: |
        Set to true to automatically add new users to the main organization (id 1). When set to
        false, new users automatically cause a new organization to be created for that new user.
      type: boolean
      default: true
    datasource_query_timeout:
      description: |
        The default timeout for querying a Grafana datasource. Each datasource can
        also configure its own preferred timeout value through relation data. If the
        value configured through relation data is larger than datasource_query_timeout
        then that value is left unchanged. The value of this configuration option must
        be a positive integer representing the maximum number of seconds Grafana will
        wait for a datasource to respond to a query.
      type: int
      default: 300
    cpu:
      description: |
        K8s cpu resource limit, e.g. "1" or "500m". Default is unset (no limit). This value is used
        for the "limits" portion of the resource requirements (the "requests" portion is
        automatically deduced from it).
        See https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/configuration/manage-resources-containers/
      type: string
    memory:
      description: |
        K8s memory resource limit, e.g. "1Gi". Default is unset (no limit). This value is used
        for the "limits" portion of the resource requirements (the "requests" portion is
        automatically deduced from it).
        See https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/configuration/manage-resources-containers/
      type: string
    reporting_enabled:
      description: |
        When disabled, Grafana will be configured to not send anonymous usage statistics to stats.grafana.org, nor
        periodically check for updates.
        It is very helpful to the Grafana project, so please leave this enabled.
        
        When enabled, Grafana will use its default values for analytics.
