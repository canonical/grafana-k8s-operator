    charms will define this information, rather than reading it at runtime. This
    class is mostly for the framework to understand what the charm has defined.

    The :attr:`maintainers`, :attr:`tags`, :attr:`terms`, :attr:`series`, and
    :attr:`extra_bindings` attributes are all lists of strings.  The
    :attr:`requires`, :attr:`provides`, :attr:`peers`, :attr:`relations`,
    :attr:`storages`, :attr:`resources`, and :attr:`payloads` attributes are all
    mappings of names to instances of the respective :class:`RelationMeta`,
    :class:`StorageMeta`, :class:`ResourceMeta`, or :class:`PayloadMeta`.

    The :attr:`relations` attribute is a convenience accessor which includes all
    of the ``requires``, ``provides``, and ``peers`` :class:`RelationMeta`
    items.  If needed, the role of the relation definition can be obtained from
    its :attr:`role <RelationMeta.role>` attribute.

    Attributes:
        name: The name of this charm
        summary: Short description of what this charm does
        description: Long description for this charm
        maintainers: A list of strings of the email addresses of the maintainers
                     of this charm.
        tags: Charm store tag metadata for categories associated with this charm.
        terms: Charm store terms that should be agreed to before this charm can
               be deployed. (Used for things like licensing issues.)
        series: The list of supported OS series that this charm can support.
                The first entry in the list is the default series that will be
                used by deploy if no other series is requested by the user.
        subordinate: True/False whether this charm is intended to be used as a
                     subordinate charm.
        min_juju_version: If supplied, indicates this charm needs features that
                          are not available in older versions of Juju.
        requires: A dict of {name: :class:`RelationMeta` } for each 'requires' relation.
        provides: A dict of {name: :class:`RelationMeta` } for each 'provides' relation.
        peers: A dict of {name: :class:`RelationMeta` } for each 'peer' relation.
        relations: A dict containing all :class:`RelationMeta` attributes (merged from other
                   sections)
        storages: A dict of {name: :class:`StorageMeta`} for each defined storage.
        resources: A dict of {name: :class:`ResourceMeta`} for each defined resource.
        payloads: A dict of {name: :class:`PayloadMeta`} for each defined payload.
        extra_bindings: A dict of additional named bindings that a charm can use
                        for network configuration.
        actions: A dict of {name: :class:`ActionMeta`} for actions that the charm has defined.
    Args:
        raw: a mapping containing the contents of metadata.yaml
